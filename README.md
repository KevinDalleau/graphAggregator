# graphAggregator

Compiled and tested with JAVA 1.8

## To aggregate a graph

* Launch the program : java -jar graphaggregator.jar. If you're working with big graphs, it is recommended to give more heap space to the JVM, using -Xmx option.
* Choose the type of input file : adj (adjacency matrix of the input graph) of arff (arff file).
* Enter the path to your file. Test files are in ./data folder. Note : if you're using ./data/adj.csv, the individual nodes are : 1,3,5.
* Enter the desired depth
* If you wish to store the adjacency matrix of the output graph, enter y, and then enter the name of the file
